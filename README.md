# EVE Static Database

CCP provides [Static Data Export(SDE)](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources),
but the original data is in YAML format, it is cumbersome to create a third party tool.
This tool converts SDE to MySQL database.

You can download the converted MySQL Database file from [here](https://doc.densan-labs.net/eve/TODO).
